      <h1 className="text-[45px] font-bold">What is a Virtual Phone Number?</h1>
      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        A simple explanation of Virtual Phone Numbers, what they are, who
        they’re for and how to get one.
      </p>
      <img className="w-full m-auto py-5"

      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        Put simply, Virtual Phone Numbers are very similar to regular phone
        numbers. The key difference being Virtual Numbers aren’t tied down to a
        specific location or device, removing any physical limitations for
        businesses.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        For example, if you have a Virtual Landline Number you could have that
        number diverted to your mobile phone. While customers call your local
        number, you can be anywhere in the country (with phone signal of course)
        and still receive the call to your mobile. The person calling you
        wouldn’t know the difference.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-[29px] font-bold">What are the benefits?</h2>
      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        Virtual Phone Numbers are a huge benefit to business owners wanting a
        professional phone setup without the hefty price tag. These numbers cost
        as little as £4.99pm+VAT making them affordable for even the smallest of
        start-ups. By using a Virtual Phone Number, businesses can look like
        they have an office anywhere in the UK, showing they are established,
        professional and trustworthy.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        Virtual Phone Numbers have the added benefit of being able to divert to
        multiple phones, perfect for growing businesses with more than one
        member of staff. For example, if there are three members of staff spread
        out over multiple locations, the call can come through to each of their
        phones and one of them can answer accordingly.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        A huge benefit is the Call Statistics feature for each number. This
        shows you how many calls your business is getting and where they are
        coming from. See your busiest hours of the day and make informed
        decisions on staffing so opportunities are never missed. Trying out new
        advertising? No more wasted ad spend. The Call Statistics feature helps
        track your offline advertising, so you can see exactly how many calls
        that ad generated. Decide if it’s worth advertising again or perhaps
        allocating that budget elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[20px] py-5">
        Other benefits include Welcome Announcements, Voicemail, Timed Call
        Diverts, Blacklist, Holiday Settings and much more. Worried about the
        costs adding up? These features are all included absolutely FREE with
        Virtual Phone Numbers from Tamar Telecommunications.
